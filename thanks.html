        <ul class="benefit-list">
            <li><strong>Blue light is only 10% of the problem</strong>—the real culprit is accommodative fatigue (sustained near-focus strain).</li>
            <li><strong>Clear vision ≠ comfortable vision</strong>—your eyes can work overtime to stay sharp, even with 20/20 vision.</li>
            <li><strong>Store-bought glasses can't fix what they don't measure</strong>—generic PD, no refraction check, and zero workload assessment.</li>
            <li><strong>A proper clinical assessment reveals what's actually happening</strong>—not guessing, not hoping, just precision.</li>
            <li><strong>Relief typically starts within days</strong>—when your eyes are properly supported, you feel it fast.</li>
