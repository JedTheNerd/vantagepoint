            <p>If you're still getting headaches even after buying blue light glasses...<br>
            If your eyes feel "tight" or tired by 3 PM...<br>
            If you're taking painkillers just to finish your workday...</p>
            
            <p><strong>You're not broken. And you're not imagining it.</strong></p>
            <p>The truth is: Blue light isn't your real problem. Your eyes are doing something most people don't realize—and store-bought glasses can't fix it.</p>
